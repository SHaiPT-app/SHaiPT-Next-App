# Ralphy Configuration
# https://github.com/michaelshimeles/ralphy

# Project info
project:
  name: "SHaiPT"
  language: "TypeScript"
  framework: "Next.js"
  description: "AI-powered personal training platform with real-time form analysis, periodized workout plans, and full nutrition suite"

# Commands
commands:
  test: "npm test"
  lint: "npm run lint"
  build: "npm run build"

# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
rules:
  - "Use Next.js App Router (not Pages Router)"
  - "Use TypeScript strict mode throughout"
  - "Use Chakra UI for component library (migrating from shadcn/ui)"
  - "Use Framer Motion for all animations and scroll-triggered effects"
  - "Use Supabase for database, auth, storage, and realtime"
  - "Use Google Gemini (Generative AI) for all AI features"
  - "Use MediaPipe for client-side pose detection and form analysis"
  - "Dark theme with neon accents is the default visual style. Primary accent color for buttons, links, CTAs, borders, glows must be NEON ORANGE (#FF6600 or similar, matching the SHaiPT logo). NEVER use blue or green as primary accent. Body text is WHITE. Background is DARK (#15151F)"
  - "NEVER use emojis anywhere in the UI — no emoji in headings, buttons, labels, descriptions, cards, or any user-facing text"
  - "All layouts must be mobile-first and responsive"
  - "Camera/MediaPipe features must work in mobile Safari and Chrome"
  - "All AI recommendations (plans, exercises, weights) must be user-editable"
  - "Types are defined in lib/types.ts - always import from there"
  - "Database operations go through lib/supabaseDb.ts"
  - "Follow existing patterns in the codebase for new features"
  - "Read PRD.md for full product requirements before implementing features"
  - "Commit to alis-branch, never directly to main. MUST git add and git commit after EVERY completed task or bug fix — do not batch multiple tasks into one commit. Push to origin/alis-branch after each commit"
  - "Gemini API is on a paid tier. Use gemini-2.5-flash model. All AI API routes should still include proper error handling and graceful fallbacks when the API key is missing"

# Boundaries - files/folders the AI should not modify
boundaries:
  never_touch:
    - "*.lock"
    - ".github/**"
    - "PRD.md"
    - ".ralphy/progress.txt"
